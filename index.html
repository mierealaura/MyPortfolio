                    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
                    <p><b> Hello, my name is Laura. </b><br> I am currently a student at the West University of Timisoara following a bachelor programme in the field of <b>Art Restoration and Conservation</b>. Prior to this, in High School, I majored in <b>Graphic Design</b>. <br> I have always had a passion for arts and discovering a large variety of ways to create it and my tendency is to choose projects based on their theme and nature — not necessarily trying to stick to the ones that fit the "established field" or niche of my profession.

                <div id="content">  
                    <p> Usually, the more new things I have to learn the better.<br>
                        Truth be told, like most other people, I sometimes fail to finish some of them because of the amount of things I need to master in a short amount of time. Most of the time though, they push me into giving my best, but also most importantly, it got me into <b>learning how to learn</b>, which i believe is one of the most important things you can focus on in the age of internet.<br><br>
                        In regards to games, not to state the obvious here, but I love playing them (from paying cards to board games and digital) since I was a little child, <b>especially anything that has dragons in it</b>. My favorite games are, of course, <b>Dragon Age Inquisition</b> and <b>Dungeons & Dragons</b>.<br><br>
                        
                        I always liked to combine a large variety of techniques and different pieces of knowledge, some of which don't have a direct link to the technical part but make the end product unique and interesting. Of course, I also have a passion for finding out the science behind the things I enjoy. That being said, I believe that the game industry is right for me.

Some portions of the game will progress in an animated  comic book fashion, where certain events will be displayed as individually drawn scenes and audio (music and dialogue) that plays along with the illustrations. Besides finding objects, the player will solve puzzles and riddles while progressing through the story.
                    The first picture to the left shows an idea of how the comic book scenarios will look like. I have created a 3D block-in of the environment so it would be easier and faster to create the scenes without worrying about perspective.

                        For Flimsy I intended a more fragile and friendly look, given by his round figure, small feet and jelly complexion.

                    <p class="stdBody">This project was made by following a tutorial made by Zach Reinhardt from CGBoost. This was part of my latest venture: finally biting the bullet and trying to learn 3D modelling. I learned how to work in Blender by making a realistic looking scene with the following components: wood planks, apples, metal bowl, fabric cloth, and a knife made from metal and wood. I would say that the most fun part was using gravity and rigid body simulation to drop the apples and the cloth into an aesthetically pleasing position.

                    <br><br>I focused more on learning the technique than following exactly what the tutor did by trying to work ahead of the tutorials and only checking to see if I went about it the right way.

The main element of both is a stylized floral shape.

                    <h1 id="textTitle">Game Rules:</h1>
                    <p>This is a game concept that I came up with to help me figure out what I want to draw when inspiration doesn’t strike me.<br>
                    The game has two modes: <b>Study</b> and <b>Creative</b><br><br>
                    
                    The rules of the game are simple:<br>
                    <span style="color: #ffffff;">
                    &emsp;1.Shuffle the cards.<br>
                    &emsp;2.Deal two of cards in a row.
                    </span>
                    <br><br>
                    
                    The first card gives you the broad category and the style in which you should work.<br>
                    The second card gives you a specific item in the category that you should work on.<br><br>

                    In the creative mode, you deal three sets of two cards, again following the same rules.<br><br>

                    For example:<br>
                    &emsp;<b id="example">A + 8 -></b> Mammals - Monkey<br>
                    &emsp;<b id="example">6 + 4 -></b> Environment - Artificial: VIP Lounge<br>
                    &emsp;<b id="example">9 + 6 -></b> Clothes - New York Italian Mafia<br><br>

                    <span style="color:#ffffff;">
                    &emsp;You now have to create an illustration,<br>
                    &emsp;in the style of your choosing, of a <br> 
                    &emsp;monkey in a high end VIP Lounge dressed <br>
                    &emsp;as an italian mobster in the 1920's.<br><br>
                    </span>

                    <p class="stdBody"><b class="stdBold">Concept:</b> I started with the idea of an illustration with one eye reflecting in broken mirror pieces, 
                        I tried to give it a mysterious vibe by adding red light on the shards. 
                        
                        Then I animated the eyes to blink using frame by frame animation in Procreate and placed them in After Effects in order to make them blink asynchronously. In the background I illustrated a person’s figure, half skull — half face, split up by another mirror piece that was placed on the side with the face.

This one is my favorite so far, it was made with the 3D function in Illustrator and some of the blending modes in Photoshop.

                        Before making the final piece I made a few sketches to find the best idea that would illustrate the given concept.
